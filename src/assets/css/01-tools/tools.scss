/*
  This contains global functions and mixins and it comes after the settings since the mixins and functions might need access to global settings.
  This layer is the second layer if you are using preprocessors. Examples are font-size mixins px-to-rem mixins, etc.
  It is important to avoid writing actual styles in the first two layers.
